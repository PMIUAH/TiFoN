# TiFoN (Timeseries Forecasting with normalization on Neural Networks)
TiFoN is a software designed to facilitate predictive time series analysis using window sliding approach. The input files will contain the time series data as a set of two-day records per row, with an hourly difference between each row. 
The software streamlines the configuration of neural networks, making setup more accessible and efficient.

This software is designed, implemented and delivered by members of de IMP (PMI) research group of the University of Alcala (Universidad de Alcalá), in Spain (España).
